# Tesla Stock Price Prediction Using SVC and Logistic Regression

This project explores machine learning–based stock price movement prediction for Tesla (TSLA) using two classical classification models: Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and Logistic Regression.

The goal is not to predict exact prices, but to classify future price direction based on historical market data and engineered features.

 # Dataset

*Source: Historical Tesla (TSLA) stock data

*Features may include:

*Open, High, Low, Close prices

*Volume

*Technical indicators (if engineered)

* Target variable:

Binary label indicating price movement (Up / Down)


# Workflow

*Data collection and preprocessing

*Feature engineering and scaling

*Train-test split

*Model training (Logistic Regression & SVC)

*Model evaluation and comparison

 # Evaluation Metrics

*Models are evaluated using standard classification metrics:

*Accuracy

*Precision

*Recall

*F1-score

*Confusion Matrix

These metrics help assess not only correctness, but also class imbalance behavior.
